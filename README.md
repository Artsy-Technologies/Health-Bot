# 🏥 ML-Based Health Chatbot

## Overview
The ML-Based Health Chatbot is a project that leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to provide users with health-related information and assistance. The chatbot can answer common health questions, provide information on symptoms, suggest possible treatments, and more.

## ✨ Features
- 🤖 Conversational interface for health-related inquiries.
- 🏥 Provides information on symptoms and possible treatments.
- 📊 Uses NLP to understand and respond to user queries.
- 🌐 Web-based interface for easy access.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- 🐍 Python 3.7 or higher
- 🤗 Transformers (Hugging Face)
- 🧠 TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch
- 🧮 NumPy
- 🐼 Pandas
- 📊 Matplotlib
- 🌐 Flask (for the web interface)
- 💬 NLTK or SpaCy (for NLP preprocessing)

### 📥 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-chatbot.git
    cd health-chatbot
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 📚 Dataset
For training, you can use publicly available health-related datasets such as the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).

### 🏋️‍♂️ Training the Model
1. Preprocess the data:
    ```python
    python preprocess_data.py --dataset_path path/to/health/dataset --output_path path/to/save/preprocessed/data
    ```

2. Train the chatbot model:
    ```python
    python train_model.py --data_path path/to/preprocessed/data --output_model_path path/to/save/model
    ```

### 💬 Using the Chatbot
To interact with the chatbot:
1. Run the chatbot server:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
    Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to start chatting with the bot.
